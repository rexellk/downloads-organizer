# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Downloads Organizer project - a tool designed to automatically organize downloaded files into appropriate directories based on file types, patterns, or custom rules.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new repository, the specific technology stack and build commands will depend on the implementation approach chosen. Common patterns for downloads organizers include:

- Python scripts with file system monitoring
- Node.js applications with file watchers
- Cross-platform desktop applications
- CLI tools with configuration files

## Architecture Notes

The core functionality typically involves:
- File system monitoring for new downloads
- Rule-based file categorization
- Directory structure management
- Configuration management for custom rules
- Logging and error handling

## Getting Started

This repository is currently empty. When implementing the downloads organizer:

1. Choose appropriate technology stack based on target platform
2. Implement file monitoring system
3. Create configurable rule engine for file organization
4. Add logging and error handling
5. Include configuration examples and documentation
